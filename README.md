# Self-contained markup compiler

**Self-contained markup compiler** (Selcon) is a simple project by me to make a simple reusable UI for some documents, such as a detailed explanation of a feature request.

This project is in development.

## Branches

The master branch `master` is the development branch.

For new features or issue fixes, you should to create a new branch rather than committing directly to master.
