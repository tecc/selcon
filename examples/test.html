            This is an example file to show how Selcon works. It demonstrates a subset of Selcon's usage.

        <div data-name="Abilities">
            <h2>Abilities</h2>

                    Selcon's intended use is to transform a HTML file to a different HTML file.
                    Sadly, nothing is that simple.

                    In reality, Selcon uses a lot of metadata to produce a finished self-contained file.
                    And even then, the output is in many cases not completely self-contained.
